      <h2>The cupcake origin</h2>
      <p>
        Amelia Simmons invented the cupcake in 1796 when she wrote a recipe
        called “a light cake to bake in small cups” in her book named “American
        Cookery”<br />However cakes in other forms have been around since <br />
        Back in the day, they were called “Number Cakes” or “1234 Cakes”. This
        was because the recipes back then were simply 1 cup of butter, 2 cups of
        sugar, 3 cups of flour, 4 eggs, 1 cup of milk, and 1 spoonful of baking
        soda. ancient times.
